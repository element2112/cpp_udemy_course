/* STRUCT VS CLASS 

    - structs members are public by default
    - class members are private by default
    
    that is the only difference
    
    
    struct:
        - Use struct for passive objects with public access
        - Don't declare methods in a struct
        
    class:
        - Use class for active objects with private access
        - Implement getters/setters as needed
        - Implement member methods as needed
